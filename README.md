# Checking gene presence/BLASTn based terminal program

A python terminal based program which can elucidate gene presence in genome assemblies, to a high statistical significance standard. It will automatically run BLASTn for you, generating dabases and running queries automatically for you. This program serves as the basis for a more complex GUI application, which will have a more practical outlook than this program specifically. As you can see, the larger FINALPROGRAM.py concatenates the functions of all the smaller programs. You can still run the smaller programs independently; for example, to avoid having to recreate databases on each program run, you can run the autoblast.py and calculate.py programs independently. 

Keep note, this code is only intended as a framework for a GUI application that can further automate and simplify user experience.
